% If you are not into tediously entering knot points by hand, you may use
% the command (note the empty array as the only argument)
%
%   s = splinep([]);
%
% which will start an interactive figure in which you choose the knot
% points with the mouse button. Press the < enter > key after selecting the
% last point, or use the right mouse button to select the last point. You
% can then use the command
%
%   replicate(s)
%
% to print something you can copy and paste into a script. As was done with
% the given set of knots above. You should try it!
